title: My 7th blog post about my journey to coding!
---

This is my 7th blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 7th post, I'll share
some of my thoughts and work I completed.

## Today I learned (#TIL): April 14 - April 18 2017

- I've been away for a few days what I have acknowledge is sometime is good to
step away from what ever you are working on to give your mind time to process
all the information you just acquired so, that's what I did! Coming back and
continuing my prerequisite on freecodecamp and reviewing my notes I wrote, I can
say the information wasn't as overwhelming as before and some of the information
I was able to have a better understanding after reviewing from the few days I've
been away.

## Useful links to save for later:

- I started to listen to a podcast called "Breaking into Startup" and one of
the episodes they have Quincy Larson the founder of "FreeCodeCamp" on there.

## My next goals:

- My goal for today Tuesday, April 18, 2017 is work for 2-3 hours of
programming from freecodecamp and codeacademy.
