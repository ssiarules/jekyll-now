title: My 3rd blog post using GitHub and Jekyll!
---

"This is my 3rd blog post. In this 3rd post, I'll share some thoughts on what I learned today and currently facing."

## Today I learned (#TIL):
- Today, I continue to work on the prerequisite from freecodecamp.com during my break at work. I learned how to concatenate strings using the (+=) operator.   
- I learned how to append variables to a string and finding the length
of a string.

##  What I;m facing:
- One of my dilemmas I am currently facing is prioritizing my time and what
I have to do for the day.

## My next goals:
- My next goal I have for myself is to start to wake up at 6:15 am.
I'm going to wake up tomorrow Tuesday, 4/11/2017 at 6:15 am. I am speaking it
to existence and I have my readers to hold me accountable! 
- I will begin the homework assignment for the week.
