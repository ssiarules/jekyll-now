title: My 9th blog post about my journey to coding!
---

This is my 9th blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 9th post, I'll share
some of my thoughts and work I completed.

## Today I learned (#TIL): Wednesday, May 3, 2017

- I was able to get an hour with of work done in the morning before work. What I learned while working on the prerequisite on freecodecamp is Local Scope in a function, the difference between Global Scope and Local Scope. I also learned that you can have both local and global variables with the same name. If this does happen the local variable will override the global variable.

Scope - refers to the visibility of variables
Global Scope - Variables which are defined outside of a function
Local Scope - Variables which are declared within a function.

<div>
               var GS = 'Global Scope';

                      Function LS(); {
                         var LS = 'Local Scope';
                ]   
</div>

## Bugs discovered / what I got stuck on:

- While working on freecodecamp I came across a problem I was having trouble solving.
 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/stand-in-line">This is the link</a>
- Also a better understanding of queue and data structure.

## My next goals:

- Continue the prerequisite work on freecodecamp and I want to start attending
atleast 1 weekly code event so I will be looking.
