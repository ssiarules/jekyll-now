This is my 10th blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 10th post, I'll share
some of my thoughts and work I completed.

## What I learned (#WIL): on Saturday, June 3, 2017

- Saturday, June 3rd was the start of Unbootcamp June 2017 hosted by Liz Krane from TeachLearnCode! Prior to the start of the first class
we had to create user stories/features for a matching app we were creating as a class. Collectively we started to create wire frames of the app we started with the user profile page and the landing page of the app. Below are a few of my user stories/features for the matching app.

1. As a beginner learner learning how to program in JavaScript, It would be a great feature if there was a progress bar for each time you are working alone or in a group so that you can see and track your journey/progress and see how you are coming along each time.

2. As a beginner learner in JavaScript tracking your progress along the way would be a great feature. Especially when learning to program there are many resources out there that can help you along the way. When you tracking your progress while learning - Reading code, working on projects, working in a group setting, working alone, all that is track so you can always look back and see what type of learning works better for you and where to devote most of your time so you can learn the material better.

3. As a beginner learner in JavaScript where and how you learn how to program matters. With this progress bar, you will be able to keep track and have the data based on Location(where you are working at co-working space, coffee shop, home, at work, etc), type of learning, actually coding, debugging, learning other people code, working on side projects), material you are learning each time( JavaScript, functions, objects, looping), who are your working with (alone, group of 2, group of 3+). At the end of each learning session, you will be able to see how much work you completed based on the progress bar.

- We also had a 1 on 1 session with mentors that was there to help us along the way. It was very cool to get insight from developers on how they started and great to ask questions that we were facing.

## My next goals:

- Continue the prerequisite work on freecodecamp and create a mock up on my community apartment finder app.
