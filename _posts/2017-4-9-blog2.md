This is my 2nd blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 2nd post, I'll share some of my thoughts and work I completed for that day.

## Today I learned (#TIL): Sunday, April 9, 2017 - 8:35pm
- Today I actually took a time away from the computer and programming to give
my self a moment to relax and process all the work I have done for the past few days. Crazy how it sound through out the day while I was out all I was thinking about was programming, visualizing the code in my mind, and reciting a few terms
I learned so far.

- What I come to realize it's better to hand write your notes compared to typing
them out on your computer, you tend to remember most of what you wrote done from
writing and reciting it back to yourself.

## My next goals:

- My goal for tomorrow Monday, April 10th, 2017 is continue the work from
freecodeacademy on Javascript and look out to Liz homework for the week.

## Remember "Your Location Is Not Your Destination"
