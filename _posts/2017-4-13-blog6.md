title: My 6th blog post about my journey to coding!
---

This is my 6th blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 6th post, I'll share
some of my thoughts and work I completed for that day.

## Today I learned (#TIL): April 13, 2017
- Thursday, was a very busy day for me I didn't quite get the chance to fully
dedicate time to review or continue my learning in JavaScript. I was pretty much
bumped because of that. Moving forward if for any reason I am not able to get
any programming work done for that day I will listen to a tech or coding podcast
just to keep my learning consistently.  

## My next goals:

- Continue working on the Homework assignment.
- Continue working on the prerequisite work on freecodecamp.com

#Daily Quote:
 - "Mind your Business" - When you minding your business and not focusing on
 what other people are doing you tend to get shit done!
