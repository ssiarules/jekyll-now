title: My 4th blog post about my journey to coding!
---

This is my 4th blog post made with Jekyll! Woohoo! In this 4th post, I'll share
some of my thoughts and work I completed for that day.

## Today I learned (#TIL):
- Yesterday, I continue to work on the prerequisite from freecodecamp.com during
my break at work. What I learned is in JavaScript and most programming languages
don't start counting at 1 they start at 0 and this is referred to as
#Zero-based indexing.
- I also learned how to use bracket notations to find characters in a string
ex: var firstName =  "Johnson";
firstLetterofFirstName = firstName[0];
//J
- I also attended "Machine Learning Meetup Group" in the evening. I was curious
to learn about with machine learning is and what does it actually do.

## What I failed to do:
- My last goal I stated in my last post "Waking up at 6:15 am to have a jump
start on my day I failed to do.

## My next goals:
- Review my notes I have written in the past few days while working in
freecodecamp.com
- Waking up at 6:15 am to jump start my day. What I have planned when I wake up
at 6:15 am is review my notes from the previous day, start to structure and map
out an idea I have and would like to create, and plan my task for the day.
